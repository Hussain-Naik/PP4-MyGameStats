## Bugs

### Known bugs

Due to the user navbar including a session detail and group detail button the code app would display error when viewing different pages which did not contain the relevant model objects. All page view included a session object with the context name of 'object_detail' to match and a method called get_group_id on the session and group model to fix the error

Due to the removal of singles badminton the game creation button on the session detail page would be removed. Upon investigating and testing the application the condition for the button display was calculated based on the session status integer multiplied by 4, which once a session was in session would require 8 players in session to display button. This was fixed by adding the correct variable 'game_type' to multiplied by 4.

### Solved bugs

There were plenty of bugs during the development process since this project was a learning platform for me and allowed me to improve my skills and knowledge significantly.

One of the bugs was due to a zero division as the win percentage to be calculated would cause an error for new users when viewing their profile page which did not contain any statistics

Due to changes to fontawesome mid way the project the application stopped displaying the icons or the fontawesome icon resizing which was used. Viewing the application with chrome dev tools it identified the broken link and i changed the fontawesome icons to bootstrap 5 native icons.
