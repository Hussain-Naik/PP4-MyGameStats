## Agile Development
The Agile framework is an iterative approach to software development. Instead of delivering a final working product at the end of the development lifecycle, teams work in small timeframes.

### Stage 1: Ideation
Badminton offers a whole host of benefits ranging from increasing life expectancy and mobility to promoting heart health and exercise for all ages and abilities.

While you’re lunging, diving, running and getting your heart pumping, playing a game of badminton can help you burn around 450 calories an hour. The varied movements provide a powerful cardio workout by engaging the entire body, including the hamstrings, quads, calves and your core.

Badminton is a fun and flexible sport that can be enjoyed around your busy schedule. You can even use your workout as an opportunity to socialise and catch-up with friends and family.

Taking part in any form of regular physical activity helps to release our natural feel good happy hormones, endorphins. In turn, this can help reduce depression, anxiety and stress and improve our overall mood and sleep. Talking to other players and rallying in singles or doubles means that badminton is a social sport. This can be particularly beneficial in combating loneliness among older players.

[My Game Stats](https://pp4-mygamestats.onrender.com/) is a badminton application. The main goal help keep users active and socialize while playing badminton. Everyone can enjoy badminton, regardless of your fitness or health. You can choose a more or less intense workout by altering the pace you’re playing at. This is to suit your individual needs and the needs and abilities of the other players as a record of previous games help to identify improvements.

#### Strategy

Developed for all levels of badminton player from beginners to professional, the app is designed to be easy to use and intuitive. The main goal of the app is to help groups organize and keep track of the match outcomes for all participating users.

### Stage 2: Development

Github Kanban board was used to keep track of tasks and issues

#### FEATURES

Please refer to the [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) file for all features-related documentation.

---

#### Design

The design of the application is based on the Material Design principles.
The central theme of the application is the simplicity of use. Thus, all the components are designed to be easy to use. The minimalistic approach was used to create something meaningful without moving out of focus. As this application is a multifunctional one and consists of many components, the decision to implement white spaces was made as it helps to create a more pleasant user experience. 

##### Color Scheme

The color scheme of the application is based on Bootstrap 5 color scheme:

  [Color Scheme](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/#using-the-new-colors)

As it may be noticed, the color scheme is based on the Material Design principles as well. The navbar is simple dark text on bootstraps light background while user navigation is the inverse light text on the dark background.

In Summary the Bootstrap 5 color scheme allows the application to be visually appealing and consistent in the design while reinforcing the applications identity to enhance the overall user experience.

##### Typography

As the application is designed using Bootstrap 5 library entirely the decision to stay with the bootstrap typography for its consistency as is uses a native font stack that selects the best font-family for each OS and device

[Typography](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/)

##### Imagery

- The main part is allocated to the use of icons from [Bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) website. The use of icons is essential for the user experience when it comes to multifunctional websites.

### Stage 5: Operations
Due to government changes to ILR application from april 2024 I have had to reduce the functionality to complete the project within the given timeframe.

#### Future Improvements and Features

**Singles Badminton**

In the future I would like to implement the singles badminton functionality

**Custom Team Selection**

In the future I would like to implement the functionality to allow sessions to create custom teams

**Sign-up and Login options**

In the future I would like to add sign-up and login with Facebook, Google, and other social media platforms.
Also, I would like to add an option to use a phone number instead of an email and send a verification code to the user's phone.

**Asynchronous functionality**

In the future I would like to make the application asynchronous. So all elements in the frontend will be updated real-time as soon as the backend sends the data.

**Security improvements**

In the future I would like to make the application foolproof against attacks and security vulnerabilities.

**User settings**

In the future I would like to more customization options for the user.

**Group chatting**

In the future I would like to add group chatting for friends and groups.

**Tournament Mode**

In the future I would like to add Tournament style games.

**User search preference**

In the future I would like to add user setting to display preferred location or time slots.
